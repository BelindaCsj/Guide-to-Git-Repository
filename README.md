# Guide-to-Offline-Git-Repository
This is a guide to Git repository usage, including how to config and use Git to manage teams' projects. In my case, team members use Windows laptops in daily work and a Linux server works as our database. The guide might still have some drawbacks. You are welcome to contact me when you meet problems and greet your contribution to the guidebook. 

Both English version and Chinese version are committed. The guide for Linux user and Windows user are separated.
